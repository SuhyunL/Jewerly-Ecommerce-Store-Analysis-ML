# **Introduction**

  

The E-commerce market is one of the fastest-growing industries. This data contains data from 2018, when fashion e-commerce began in earnest worldwide, to 2020, when the e-commerce market showed remarkable growth through Covid-19. I want to view this data from 3 big perspectives of sales - Brand, Product, and Sales.


# **Analysis**
## **ðŸ”¹ Sales Analysis**

### 1. Sales by time

**Do the sales depend by time? (ex. day, month, or seasons?)**

- Sales by Month

Before Covid-19, Sales increased on holiday seasons, especially at the end of the year.

Nevertheless, recently, after the Covid-19, the virus impacted sales more than the month. If there are higher cases, sales get lower immediately. When there are lower cases, sales increase. Higher cases made people stay inside, which reduced the spending for apparel to go outside.

- Sales by time

It turned out that 10 AM-1 PM is the golden hour for daily sales.

- Sales by day
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75061420/126740025-60465941-2a60-4c1a-a30c-8a349ebab6d4.png' width='75%' align="center">

Sales peaked on Thursday. Sales decreased during the weekend when people went outside, and online sales hit the apex.

  

### 2. Sales by Frequency of Repurchase

**How high is the repurchase rate?**
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75061420/126740142-85b404cc-f023-4798-b613-93d6fc79fb9a.png)

  
The repurchase rate is 17%, which is comparatively very high. There is a high frequency until the second repurchase, but the frequency decreases significantly from the number of repurchases. Meanwhile, the most repurchases are 231.

  

**Are there any brands that are particularly repurchased?**
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75061420/126740325-18b2617b-b131-4af9-bf6f-af241944c6d4.png' width='100%' align="left">

  

Brand 1, one of the highest-sales brands, shows a 53% remarkably high repurchase rate, which means repurchase accounts for more than half of their entire purchase.

  

  

## **ðŸ”¹ Brand Analysis**

**What is an overall landscape of brands?**
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75061420/126740389-734b20e4-d6ee-415e-a4d7-9bc866e54521.png' width='50%'>


Brand #0 and #1 account for most of the sales. Brand #6 is very rarely purchased.

**How is the game-changing by each brand? Which brand has the biggest potential?**
<img src = 'https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75061420/126740348-fd984090-73ab-41c9-a6b2-821f24e7af1a.png' width='60%'>

Brand #0 was a conventional winner. Meanwhile, Brand #1 is showing rapid growth, fiercely chasing its competitor brand #0, and finally turned the table. Brand #1 seems to have the most significant potential.

  

  

## **ðŸ”¹ Trend Analysis**

### 1. A trend from a perspective of product
**- How long does each trendy product last?**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75061420/126740691-9c2cdc97-5c27-4ca4-ab8a-98003ecf8c56.png)

It greatly differs by-products. Some trends last, some trends vanish.

**- What does each trend cycle looks like? Are they mostly look alike?**

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75061420/126741219-e65001b2-5529-4985-9564-0258ac75f8f4.png)

  In most cases, the left tail is elongated, and they suddenly decrease after reaching the apex. Outside of their steep growth, it looks similar to PLC. The steeper growth can be reasoned as the bigger boost in the fashion industry when certain products become trendy.

 
**- Does trend leader exist?**
> Yes, they exist. There was even a customer that 70% of the product that he/she bought became trendy afterward. For example, Customer #757 was an early buyer of 61 out of 86 trending products. 70% of the products this customer bought became trendy. #41, #49, and #59 were also the trend leaders as being early buyers of the majority of trending products.

  

**- What about Trend Followers?**
There were trend followers, also. There were about 10,000 people, which is nearly 25% of all customers. Customers #805, #77b4, #437 bought all of the trending products and even repurchased some of them. More than 30 people bought half of all the trending products.

  

**- What seems like an upcoming trend?**

According to the trend leaders' recent purchases, a Gold ring with a diamond seems like a trend.

# **Machine Learning Model**

## **ðŸ”¹ Insights**

### 1. Sales Analysis
Covid directly impacted Sales. Meanwhile, the out repurchase rate is 17%, which is very high compared to other jewelry shops.

### 2. Brand Analysis
Brand #1 seems to have the biggest potential. Brand #1 shows rapid growth, fiercely chasing its competitor brand #0, and finally turned the table.

### 3. Trend Analysis
Trend and Trend leader existed. Most of the trends were drawing PLC lines, and there were some trend leaders who have shown 70% accuracy. According to the trend leaders' recent purchases, a Gold ring with a diamond seems like a trend.

  

## **ðŸ”¹ Modeling**

We need to highlight our strength to increase sales- the high repurchase rate. The core of a high repurchase rate is a reasonable price and good products. The price turned out to be reasonable, but the problem was with the products. There are too many products that are purchased only once (low sales). The trend exists, but the trendy products are hardly noticeable as there are too many products that are behind the trend, interfering with the exposure.

 

Therefore, we need a machine learning model which can predict future sales and leave sellable products so we can improve product pools, which will eventually raise the repurchase rate.

  

### Model 1. Binary Classification Model

- Predicts whether a product will be sold next quarter or not.
- Feature selection: Didn't select the feature- used the full feature but noised each of it, so the model chose actual impact features by itself.
- Model: XGB Boost (showed best performance in multiple experiments/ n_estimators = 400, scale_pos_weight = ratio, max_depth = 9, subsample = 0.9)
- Performance: Detected 80% of non-sold item & 93% of sold items.


### Model 2. Rigression Model

- Predicts how much it would be sold next quarter.
- Feature selection: Used most of the features and left it to the model itself, but deleted 'quantity-per quarter' feature as it can cause data leakage.
- Model: LGBMRegressor(num_boost_round = 1000, learning_rate = 0.1, num_iterations = 90, max_depth = 8, metric = 'l1', max_bin = 446, min_data = 42)
- Performance: R2 0.82/ MAE 983/ MSE 3187948/ RMSE 1785

  

  

# **Expected Effect**

- Improve overall product composition and save cost by leaving products worth selling.
- Able to focus on potential items by predicting following quarter sales by-products.
- Eventually, enhance repurchase rate and overcome stagnant sales.
